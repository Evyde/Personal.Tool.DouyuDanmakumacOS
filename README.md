# Douyu_Danmaku_For_macOS
[中文文档](READMES/README_zh_CN.md)  |  [English](README.md)  

I found that there is not a usable Danmaku software for douyu, So I made this with simple danmaku announcement and gift notification.  

# Usage
When stable version released, there will be a installer and installing it directly will be good.  
Talking about the other items, like the menu, I have no idea about that, see u tomorrow~  

# TODO List
- [ ] Display danmuku on TouchBar.

# Known Issues
Fortunately, none until now.
